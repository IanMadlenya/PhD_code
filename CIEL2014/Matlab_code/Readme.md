To Matlab Users
===============

Because I did not have full license of Matlab, it is very difficult
for me to convert my R code to Matlab code.

Please try to install R to you computer. It is free and powerful.

You can download R from R's official website: 
https://www.r-project.org/

and you can also download a free IDE for R called R studio:

about Matlab code conversion
----------------------------
I will not convert my code to Matlab code and please try to either
use R to do the job or to convert by your own.
